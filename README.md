## Overview

This is a workflow repository for definitions and processing related to the development and analysis
of Austrian energy and emissions scenarios.

### Project nomenclature

The folder `definitions` can contain the project nomenclature, i.e., list of allowed
variables and regions, for use in the validation workflow. See the **nomenclature**
package for more information ([link](https://github.com/iamconsortium/nomenclature)).

The folder `mappings` can contain model mappings that are used to register models and
define how results should be processed upon upload to a Scenario Explorer.

### Workflow

The module `workflow.py` has a function `main(df: pyam.IamDataFrame) -> pyam.IamDataFrame:`.

Per default, this function takes an **IamDataFrame** and returns it without
modifications. [Read the docs](https://pyam-iamc.readthedocs.io) for more information
about the **pyam** package for scenario analysis and data visualization.
